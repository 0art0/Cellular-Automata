	<p>Consider an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells which can be coloured either white or black
(see the interactive application). The white tiles represent the state 0 and the black tiles represent
the state 1. </p>
	<p>Start with an pattern of cells on the board (preferably in the centre) and play the animation. The
initial pattern evolves according to the following rule: at each time step, the colour of a cell is
changed to the sum of the colours of its four orthogonal neighbours, modulo 2.</p>
	<p>In other words, the colour of a cell at each step is computed by taking the sum of the colours of the
cells situated at the top, bottom, left and right (with the convention that black cells represent 1 and
white cells represent 0) and colouring it white if the sum is even and black if it is odd. Note that all
cells are updated simultaneously.</p>
	<p>Observe that while the initial pattern becomes blurred after the first few time-steps, copies of it
eventually re-emerge after a few more iterations of the animation. Explain this phenomenon.</p>
